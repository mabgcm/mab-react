The website incorporates jQuery for enhanced interactivity, Bootstrap for responsive design, and Magnific Popup for modal windows. It also makes use of Waypoints and CounterUp for scroll-based animations and Swiper for image sliders. Paroller is used to add parallax scrolling effects, while AOS (Animate On Scroll) library brings additional animations to the site. Owl Carousel is used for creating dynamic carousels, and AJAX enables seamless loading of content. The website also features a RangeSlider for interactive range selection and Switcher for customizable themes. I was involved in implementing these technologies and ensuring their smooth integration into the website's design and functionality. Additionally, the Harvelli Web Site includes SEO (Search Engine Optimization) features to improve its visibility on search engines. This includes optimizing meta tags, using descriptive headings and alt tags for images, and implementing proper URL structure. Furthermore, the website incorporates a blog section where the company can regularly publish articles, news, and updates. The blog allows for easy content management and provides a platform for engaging with the audience through comments and social sharing.",
